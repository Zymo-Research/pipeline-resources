built on [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) platform.

The backbone of the pipeline includes:

1.  Input reads trimming by
    [TrimGalore](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore).

2.  Reads quality assessment by
    [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC).

3.  Reads alignment by
    [bismark](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark).

4.  Methylation calling by
    [MethylDackel](https://github.com/dpryan79/MethylDackel).

5.  Library insert size distribution by
    [picard](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037055772-CollectInsertSizeMetrics-Picard-).

6.  Read coverage per cytosine by
    [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Report overview

This bioinformatics report is generated using
[MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/), which is integrated into the nextflow
pipeline. There are general instructions on how to read a MultiQC report
at [here](https://multiqc.info/docs/#using-multiqc-reports), or you can
watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPbIlO_KWN0). In
general, the report has a navigation bar to the left, allowing to
quickly navigate to any section in the report. Next to it on the right
are result sections, which are interactive: hovering mouse over or
clicking these tables/figures will lead to more details. On the right
edge, there is a toolbox that allows to customize the appearance of the
report and export figures and data.

## General Statistics

The table _General Statistics_ provides some import statistics of the
data. Here are some you can use to assess the data:

- **# Reads** This is the total number of read pairs (or reads in single-end
  sequencing) contained in the FASTQ file(s) before trimming.

- **% Aligned** This is the percentage of total uniquely
  aligned read pairs (or reads in single-end sequencing) to the target
  genome. In general, the higher the percentage, the better. The value
  however varies among sample types and library protocols. The total
  number of reads is shown in column `# Reads`.

- **% BS Conversion** This metric provides another
  measurement on BS conversion rates, calculated as 1 minus the
  average methylation level in the CHG and CHH contexts, assuming no
  methylation at all in those two contexts. However, the assumption
  may not be valid in some circumstances such as in plant, so a BS
  conversion rate from Spike-ins is a better estimate.

- **# Unique CpG** This is the number of CpG cytosines in the genome
  covered by reads.

- **Avg. CpG Coverage** This is the average number of reads covering
  each cytosine as reported in the `Unique CpG` column. Please also
  refer to the section [CpG Coverage](#cpg-coverage) for the counts of
  cytosines at different read coverage levels.

## FastQC (raw)

This section shows the _FastQC_ analyses run on **raw** fastq files.
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/)
is a tool to analyze library qualities by examining the metrics such as
base qualities, GC content, overrepresented and adapter sequences. A
warning is issued if any metric fails.

### Sequence Counts

The histogram show the number of PE/SE reads for each sample. Duplicate reads
are an estimate only and are separated from unique reads.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_sequence_counts_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Sequence Quality Histograms

This section shows the average [Phred quality
scores](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531872-Phred-scaled-quality-scores)
per base along read length. Normally, the base quality decreases towards
3’end. This provides information on whether 3’end quality trimming is
needed.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_per_base_sequence_quality_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Per Sequence Quality Scores

This plot shows the distributions of read sequence quality, computed by
averaging the Phred scores of all bases in a read. It is expected that
peaks are at values &gt; 28; if you see peaks at lower values, it is a
warning sign of low quality libraries.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_per_sequence_quality_scores_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Per Base Sequence Content

This plot shows the percentages of the four nucleotides (A, T, C, G) at
each read position; each base is in different color. The heatmap shows
average base compositions with samples as rows and positions as columns.
When hovering mouse over the plot, the nucleotide compositions are shown
at top of the plot.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_per_base_sequence_content_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

One can click on one row/sample to have a detailed view on how
nucleotide composition changes over read length. The composition is
expected to be even over read length.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_per_base_sequence_content_plot.zoom.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Per Sequence GC Content

This plot shows the distributions of reads’ GC content, that is, the
percentages of G and C nucleotides in a read.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_per_sequence_gc_content_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Per Base N Content

The plots shows the percentage of an undetermined basecall `N` at each position. Reads with N content greater than 5% usually indicates poor sequencing quality or other technical issues.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_per_base_n_content_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Sequence Length Distribution

The plots provides insights into the distribution of sequence lenghs obtained
from the input fastq files. For raw reads that contain uniform sequence length, normally only a highlighted text `All samples have sequences of a single length (XXX bp)` should be displayed in this section. For trimmed reads, the peak of the lineplot may vary depending on the library size and some other factors.

### Sequence Duplication Levels

Duplicated sequences refer to the occurance of the same or highly similar reads that can arise from PCR artifacts or biological duplicats. In a diverse library like WGBS, the majority of the reads should occur only once. Therefore, the highest peak should be observed on the leftmost side of the plot. A warning will be issued if non-unique sequences make up more than 20% of the total.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_sequence_duplication_levels_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Overrepresented sequences

If there are overrepresented sequences, such as contamination, enriched
fragments, or duplicated reads, this section will show the frequencies
of the top representative sequences (frequency &gt; 0.1%).

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_overrepresented_sequences_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Adapter Content

This plot shows the percentage of reads containing an adapter sequence
at each base position cumulatively, so if a read contains an adapter at
a position, then this read is counted for all subsequent positions.

When running this analysis on already trimmed sequences, one expects to
see no adapters, as displayed here.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/fastqc_adapter_content_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Cutadapt

TrimGalore internally calls `cutadapt` to trim low-quality bases and
adapters from reads. This section presents the results of trimmed
fragments and the remained reads after trimming and filtering.

### Trimmed Sequence Lengths

In this plot, the x-axis shows the length of each trimmed fragment (the
part discarded), and the y-axis shows the number of reads for each case.
Normally, the number drops quickly as the lengths of trimmed segments
increase, because for most reads, only a few bases are derived from
adapters or of low quality. For RRBS, however you may see some peaks in
the middle because of short library insert sizes.

The tab `Obs/Exp` presents the ratio of observed and expected counts for
a given trimmed length. The expected count is computed by assuming
sequencing error only. A ratio higher than 1 indicates that some trimmed
segments are true adapters. One can see [cutadapt’s
guide](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#how-to-read-the-report)
for more explanation.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/cutadapt_trimmed_sequences_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Filtered Reads

In this plot, it shows the number of reads passing the filtering of
TrimGalore. TrimGalore trims low-quality bases and adapters from the
3’end of each read and filters out reads that are shorter than 20bps.
And in the paired-end mode, both reads in a pair are discarded if either
of them is shorter than 20 bps, and this is why the read1 and read2
files of one sample always have the same number of filtered reads.

For RRBS sequencing, the option `--rrbs` for TrimGalore is on to remove
filled-in bases at read ends introduced during library preparation. For
more details on how TrimGalore removes the filled-ins, please refer to
the [TrimGalore
Manual](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md#step-2-adapter-trimming).

One can toggle the tabs between _Counts_ and _Percentages_ to view the
numbers and percentages of filtered reads, a feature available for most
plots in the report.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/trimgalore_filtered_reads_plot.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## FastQC (trimmed)

This section shows the _FastQC_ analyses run on **trimmed** fastq files. By default, raw reads will go through quality trimming and adapter trimming before alignment. Please refer to [FastQC (raw)](#fastqc-raw) because of the similar functionality.

## Bismark

[Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/)
is a tool to align bisulfite-converted sequencing reads to a genome. One
can find the manual of the program at
[here](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark).

### Alignment Rates

This plot shows the number and percentage of reads in each of the
following categories:

- Aligned Uniquely: reads that are mapped to a unique genomic
  position.

- Aligned Ambiguously: reads that are mappable to multiple genomic
  positions.

- Did Not Align: reads that are not alignable to the genome.

For downstream analyses such as calling methylation, only _Aligned
Uniquely_ reads are used.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/bismark_alignment.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Strand Alignment

This plot shows which strand each read pair is aligned to. Due to
bisulfite conversion, there are four strands that a read pair can align:

1.  Original top strand: the top/Waston strand.

2.  Complementary to original top strand: the strands complementary to
    the top/Waston strands, generated through PCR.

3.  Original bottom strand: the bottom/Crick strand.

4.  Complementary to original bottom strand: the strand complementary to
    the bottom/Crick strand, generated through PCR.

For a directional sequencing library, you may only see reads from
original top and bottom strands, but for non-directional one, you will
see reads from all four strands.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/bismark_strand_alignment.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### M-bias

This plot presents the methylation values along base positions in a
read. The methylation value is computed by averaging the methylation
values at a position across all reads in a sample. Normally, one expects
the methylation value stays constant along base positions.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/bismark_mbias.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Picard

This shows the distribution of estimated insert sizes for each sample.
For RRBS, one may see multiple spikes in the range from 40 to 220 bps
due to _MspI_ digestions (see explanation
[here](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/RRBS_Guide.pdf)).

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/picard_insert_size.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## CpG Coverage

This plot presents the number and percentage of cytosines in CpG context
under different read coverages. Here, only cytosines covered by at least
one read are considered. For easy visualization, the read coverage (aka.
read depth) is divided into four ranges: 1-4, 5-9, 10-49, 50-99, &gt;=100.

<img src="../../images/methylcheck/cpg_coverage.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
